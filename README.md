## Overview

Horizon Atlas aims to solve the challenge of scaling multiplayer game worlds by acting as an intelligent proxy layer between game clients and distributed game server instances. The current implementation provides the foundational architecture for dynamic connection routing based on spatial positioning.

### Current State

This is an **early-stage** project with core infrastructure implemented but many advanced features still in development. The codebase demonstrates solid architectural foundations with proper async patterns, comprehensive error handling, and modular design.

## Current Features

### ✅ Implemented

#### WebSocket Proxy Server
- **Async WebSocket Handling**: Built on Axum with tokio-tungstenite for async WebSocket connections
- **Message Protocol**: Complete message type system (`PlayerConnect`, `PlayerMove`, `PlayerAction`, `ServerTransfer`, `Heartbeat`, `StateSync`)
- **Connection Management**: Client connection tracking and basic routing to game servers

#### Security and Compression  
- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Ring-based cryptography for client message encryption/decryption
- **LZ4 Compression**: High-speed compression with configurable thresholds
- **Delta Compression**: Efficient binary delta generation for state synchronization

#### Spatial Management
- **3D Positioning**: Vector3 coordinate system with distance calculations
- **Server Boundaries**: Spatial boundary checking and server assignment logic
- **Transfer Logic**: Distance-based server transfer recommendations

#### Configuration and Monitoring
- **TOML Configuration**: Comprehensive configuration system with environment variable support
- **HTTP Endpoints**: Basic health (`/health`) and metrics (`/metrics`) endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured logging with performance monitoring throughout

#### Cluster Framework
- **Node Management**: Basic cluster node registration and tracking
- **Load Balancing**: Connection-count based load distribution algorithms
- **Health Monitoring**: Node heartbeat and failure detection framework

#### Docker Support
- **Multi-stage Build**: Optimized Docker builds with Alpine Linux
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-node cluster deployment configuration

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented

- **Cluster Coordination**: Node management framework exists, but peer discovery is stubbed
- **Game Server Integration**: Server lifecycle management framework without actual provisioning
- **Metrics Collection**: Basic metrics exposed, but limited to connection counts and server stats

- Comprehensive error handling with `anyhow::Result`
- Document public APIs with `///` comments
- Include performance considerations in reviews

### Code Quality

```bash
# Required checks before PR
cargo fmt --check    # Code formatting

## Project Status

### Current State: **Early Alpha**

- ✅ **Core Architecture**: Solid foundation with proper async patterns
- ✅ **Basic Functionality**: WebSocket proxy with encryption/compression works
- ✅ **Spatial Logic**: 3D coordinate system and server assignment implemented
- ⚠️ **Cluster Coordination**: Framework exists but discovery is stubbed
- ❌ **Production Ready**: Missing persistence, advanced monitoring, service discovery

### Stability Assessment

- **Development**: Suitable for experimentation and contribution
- **Testing**: Good for integration testing and proof-of-concepts
- **Production**: **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Missing critical production features

### Known Limitations

1. **No Database Persistence**: All state is in-memory only
2. **Stubbed Service Discovery**: Cluster nodes cannot actually discover each other
3. **Basic Game Server Integration**: Server lifecycle management is incomplete
4. **Limited Monitoring**: Only basic connection and server metrics available

## License

**To be determined.**

The project license will be finalized before the first stable release.
